// This file initializes a Prisma Client instance for use in the application.
// It ensures that the Prisma Client is only instantiated once in development mode
// to avoid issues with hot reloading. In production, a new instance is created each time.
// The Prisma Client is exported for use in other parts of the application, such as API routes or server-side functions.

// Why singleton: Prisma recommends one PrismaClient instance to avoid exhausting connections 
// and other issues (even though SQLite doesnâ€™t pool in the same way).
